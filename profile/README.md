# Kalvad

We build and open-source tools for **modern infrastructure, databases, and data platforms**.

Engineering-led. Production-tested. Open by default.

## What we do

Kalvad is a team of engineers focused on solving hard infrastructure and data problems:
- Designing and operating **reliable, scalable systems**
- Building **developer-first tooling** around databases and observability
- Turning real production needs into **open-source projects**

Most of what you’ll find here comes directly from challenges we’ve faced in the field.

## Open source at Kalvad
